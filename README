Callvote plugin for BigBrotherBot (www.bigbrotherbot.net)
=============================================================

By Fenix


Description
-----------
This plugin is able to handle Client Callvote and Client Vote events provided by the new iourt42 parser.
Since there is a bit of delay between a /callvote command being issued on the servervand the b3 generating the corresponding event, 
we probably are not able to control everything.
As an example think about this situation:

    Bob  - Team Red
    Tom  - Team Spectator
    Lisa - Team Spectator
 
If Bob issue a /callvote command, the votation will end as soon as the countdown starts since he's the only one able to do /vote 
(spectators are excluded by the server engine and the player who issued the votation automatically voted F1 - go figure).

At the current state what we can do is:

    - check how many players are able to issue a /vote command
    - if more than 1, perform all the controls we need, otherwise handle directly the end of the current votation, in order to avoid problems (timing related)


Installation
------------

 * copy callvote.py into b3/extplugins
 * copy callvote.xml into b3/extplugins/conf
 * create necessary table by importing callvote.sql into your MySQL database
 * edit your b3.xml config file adding :
 
       <plugin name="callvote" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/callvote.xml"/>
